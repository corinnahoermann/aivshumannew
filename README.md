"Charting New Territories - The Dual Role of AI and Human Effort in Academic Publishing"

The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in research and academic publishing has been a topic of growing interest and debate. While some argue that AI-based systems have the potential to revolutionize the way scientific papers and academic work are generated, others express concerns about the authenticity of AI-authored papers. This critical analysis examines the advantages and disadvantages of AI-authored scientific papers compared to those authored by humans. The underlying work describes the process of creating different papers solely with the help of ChatGPT or Jenni AI and compares them to human-written drafts. Additionally, this extended study incorporates evaluations from scientists who assessed the quality, authenticity, and effectiveness of AI-generated papers. Their feedback provides data that deepens the analysis and enriches the discussion on the potential and limitations of AI tools in academic writing. The results highlight that while AI-driven tools significantly facilitate the drafting of outlines, titles, and compositions, high-quality scientific academic publications still demand substantial human input, including creative effort and critical thinking, to ensure depth, originality, and scholarly rigor.
